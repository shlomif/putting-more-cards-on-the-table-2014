“Putting More Cards on the Table (2014)”

This is an essay that is composed of several sections that are mostly
self-contained, but in a way build upon each other. It is the sequel to
http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/ .

Work started on [Putting More Cards on the Table (2014)](https://bitbucket.org/shlomif/putting-more-cards-on-the-table-2014) which is a sequel to this popular essay of mine: http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/ . The main differences are:

1. I will use a custom XML grammar for writing it. (XML is like violence: if it didn't solve your problem, you have not used enough of it.).

2. I plan to incorporate many images, videos, etc. into the document to spice it up.

Cheers, and comments and contributions are welcome.
