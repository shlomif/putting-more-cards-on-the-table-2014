                    <p>
                        Since <a
                            href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/">“Putting
                            All the Cards on the Table (2014)”</a> was written and
                        finalised, I kept linking to individual sections of it, and
                        it proved to be popular and many people liked it or
                        individual sections of it. One thing I now regret about it
                        is the word "All" because I now realise that <b>honesty is
                            a process</b>, and so is <b>enlightenment</b> and if
                        you stop searching for a bigger and better “truth”, you
                        stop being honest.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Nevertheless, after over a year, I feel that a sequel to it
                        is in order, collecting and organising a <b>(hopefully
                            large) subset</b> of the various insights I collected
                        in many posts and insights on various social media outlets,
                        some stories, screenplays, aphorisms, etc. So here goes.

                    <p>
                        Many people I know are being far too much misers: they
                        care too much about people not spending a small amount of
                        money, which in turn will buy them some time, bring them
                        joy, or enlighten and/or inspire them. However, the time
                        of productive humans, as well as their self-esteem and
                        spiritual and tangible possessions, are far more important
                        than a small gain of money.
