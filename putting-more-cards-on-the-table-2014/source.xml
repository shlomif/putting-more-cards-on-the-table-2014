                <p>
                    Since <a
                        href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/">“Putting
                        All the Cards on the Table (2014)”</a> was written and
                    finalised, I kept linking to individual sections of it, and
                    it proved to be popular and many people liked it or
                    individual sections of it. One thing I now regret about it
                    is the word "All" because I now realise that <b>honesty is
                        a process</b>, and so is <b>enlightenment</b> and if
                    you stop searching for a bigger and better “truth”, you
                    stop being honest.
                </p>

                    Nevertheless, after over a year, I feel that a sequel to it
                    is in order, collecting and organising a <b>(hopefully
                        large) subset</b> of the various insights I collected
                    in many posts and insights on various social media outlets,
                    some stories, screenplays, aphorisms, etc. So here goes.

                <p>
                    Many people I know are being far too much misers: they
                    care too much about people not spending a small amount of
                    money, which in turn will buy them some time, bring them
                    joy, or enlighten and/or inspire them. However, the time
                    of productive humans, as well as their self-esteem and
                    spiritual and tangible possessions, are far more important
                    than a small gain of money.
