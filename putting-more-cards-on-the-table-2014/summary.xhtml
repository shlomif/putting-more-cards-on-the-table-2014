<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
Since <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/">“Putting
    All the Cards on the Table (2014)”</a> was written and finalised, I kept
linking to individual sections of it, and it proved to be popular and many
people liked it or individual sections of it. One thing I now regret about it
is the word "All" because I now realise that <b>honesty is a process</b>,
and so is <b>enlightenment</b> and if you stop searching for a bigger and
better “truth”, you stop being honest.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, after over a year, I feel that a sequel to it is in order,
collecting and organising <b>a (hopefully large) subset</b> of the various
insights I collected in many posts and insights on various social media
outlets, some stories, screenplays, aphorisms, etc. So here goes.
</p>

<pre>
* Honesty/Enlightenment/etc. is a process.
    - Must always seek to be more honest and a better person.
* Time &gt;&gt;&gt; Money.
    - Many NPOs/NGOs have a lot of money and too little volunteer time.
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar saying that she now
    has enough time to donate to causes which she considers worthy (despite
    now being a mother).
* Hubris and Neophilia in moderation are important.

    - Christina Grimmie.
        - Feeling Good.
* Sexual attractiveness → Competence (And vice-versa).
* Honest vs. Dishonest advertising.

* From https://plus.google.com/+ShlomiFish/posts/i5Z8XdqTdwE :

* The proper way to run an election campaign:

««««««
I detailed the way I thought of to run an election campaign here: http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/human-hacking/human-hacking-field-guide-v2/homecoming_queen.html - on that section, the story’s Alpha Female, Eve “Erisa” Siegel, admits that winning the title of homecoming queen won’t make much of a difference to her, but that she still wants it, and instead of a smear or insult campaign, she supports and respects the other candidates.

Furthermore, you shouldn't give up if you lose ( #NeverGiveUp : Matsuoka Shuzo [松岡修造 ] - あきらめかけているあなた (NEVER GIVE UP!!) [English] ), and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentatonix released videos on YouTube before, while, and after their performance on the televised Sing-off competition (and I find them very nice). What I describe Principle Snyder doing in http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Buffy/A-Few-Good-Slayers/ is that after he has lost the election for mayor, he offered the actual winner to be his assistant and to help him as much as he can, and he eventually become mayor in the next election .

Hollywood depicted a worse way to run an election campaign with Hulk Hogan on Suddenly Susan where he maintains a false image instead of being himself - https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hollywood%20hogan%20suddenly%20susan (these were my favourite two episodes of that show). And this whole ordeal materialised with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_schwarzenegger 's “Girly Men” campaign for the Californian  governor elections, but really could have been avoided.

There are three important things in life for one’s self-esteem:

1. Good food and drinks ("Wine") - see http://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/27195/maimonides-advice-about-dieting

2. Good company of any sex ("Women").

3. Clean, creative, fun, however unprofessional and low quality. ("Song"): Christina Grimmie - "Feelin' Good"

If you're a wage slave, who does not eat well, does not enjoy the company of
his family or friends, and does not have fun, then not only are you unhappy,
but you are really unproductive and lazy:

.

* Classical music:
    - museum pieces.

    - Remakes / covers / fanfiction.
        - Lessig’s Remix book.
        - crossovers / mash-ups.

* https://twitter.com/AlexGMusic8/status/474284103349456896
    - «I just genuinely don't understand the need for complete and utter 100%
      nakedness in the women's locker room at the gym. Ahhhhhh #help»
    - What my friend noted about him being a "heterophobe" who cannot stand
    seeing other men naked.
        - That only women will get it.
    - Noting that people should still be free to experience (or produce)
    porn or soft porn or erotica or whatever in the privacy of their
    own home.
