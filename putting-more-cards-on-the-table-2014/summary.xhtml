<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
Since <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/">“Putting
    All the Cards on the Table (2014)”</a> was written and finalised, I kept
linking to individual sections of it, and it proved to be popular and many
people liked it or individual sections of it. One thing I now regret about it
is the word "All" because I now realise that <b>honesty is a process</b>,
and so is <b>enlightenment</b> and if you stop searching for a bigger and
better “truth”, you stop being honest.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, after over a year, I feel that a sequel to it is in order,
collecting and organising <b>a (hopefully large) subset</b> of the various
insights I collected in many posts and insights on various social media
outlets, some stories, screenplays, aphorisms, etc. So here goes.
</p>
